    <string name="about_daniel">
        "   Hi, my name is Daniel.
        I am the student of Computer Science at Polish- Japanese academy of Computer Technologies. I was also studying at SGH (Warsaw School of Economics). Since I didn't really enjoy economics, I've decided to switch to engineering. I am passionate about creating things and inventing new solutions to our daily problems. This is why I've changed my college.
        My mission is to bring more value to the IT world and contribute to some great work.
